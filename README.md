<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

In a Vite project, you can work in two different modes: development and production. Each mode serves a specific purpose and has its own configuration settings. 

Understanding how to switch between these modes is essential for efficient development and deployment of your Vite project.

<h3>Development</h3>

1. To start your Vite project in development mode, open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash npm install ```

   This will ensure that all required dependencies are installed.
3. Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash npm run dev ```

4. As you make changes to your project's source code, Vite will automatically update the browser with the latest changes without requiring a full page reload. This hot module replacement feature helps in faster development iterations.

<h3>Production</h3>

1. When you are ready to build your Vite project for production, open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

    Run the following command to create a production-ready build:

    ```bash npm run build ```

    This command will generate an optimized bundle of your project in the dist directory.

2. Once the build process completes, you can deploy the contents of the dist directory to a static file hosting service or a web server of your choice.

3. The production build will have minimized and optimized code, ensuring faster loading times and better performance in a production environment.
